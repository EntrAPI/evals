Too many people act like \"tech snobs\" when talking about Bitcoin. I honestly hate talking about this topic. Because the key to success is what I always say: Physical Emotional Creative Spiritual Health. I only know that because when I've been on the floor and in pain (bad business, bad breakup, bad breath, bad everything), these four things have been the only thing that have helped. When at bottom, all of this is BS: Not knowing what stock to pick. Or what \"crypto\" to pick. Or what conversation topic would be hot at a cocktail party. Or even having money in the bank. Nothing would help except those four areas of health. That saved my life. One day, one week without all four being checked off each day, and my life slips. I don't want my life to slip. I want it to compound every. Please let me stay disciplined and be good and be helpful. BUT...so many people asking me now about Bitcoin. So many scams out there. So many people proud of their \"tech jargon\" that actually know nothing about Bitcoin or why it's important. Just read this. Then do what you want. This is an answer I made on Quora.

You have what you need within this state of ~meh~ to get through this, and even to transform. You know more than you think.  You are more capable than you feel right now.   PS: No I\u2019m not selling a course. I use this dumb butterfly metaphor with all my friends who ask me for (questionable) life advice.  PPS: If you need questionable life advice, call me. PPPS: Yes that\u2019s a disco ball planter. Yes, I\u2019ll make you one.  Check the  #CareerChallenges  hashtag for more stories, and good luck!

But \"this time it's different\" is finally true because this is the first time in history the government has ordered us to stay at home and not work.

The bigger he grew the more scared Balram was. Seeing him grow Balram fainted. Then demon turned his attention to Krishna. He said, \"I am demon the size of your fear.\" Krishna looked at him nonchalantly & started playing his flute. The demon grew smaller & smaller till he disappeared. When Balram got up, he realised his  #mistake .   We live in scary times today & need to let our  #faith  win over fears. Let's make a conscious effort to have our faith in good things in life.   1) Meditate & keep calm - Your positive energies can make your immunity higher   2) Relax - Listen to music, dance or do what makes you happy   3) Hear, say & listen to good things.    4) Spend time with people who uplift you instead of those who bring you down   5) Stay safe but be kind & loving too.

It opens you up to new challenges and opportunities. If you wait until you feel ready to pursue an opportunity, chances are it\u2019ll pass you by. Saying yes means that you\u2019re open to moving past your comfort zone and embracing a new challenge.  2. It invites collaboration. There\u2019s a reason improvisation is rooted in the phrase, \u201cYes, and...\u201d Unlike no, which shuts down conversations and progress, saying yes opens up positive possibilities and invites others to build together, fostering collaboration, partnership, and further discussion. 3. It empowers and affirms others. As a leader, choosing to say yes acts as an affirmation to others and their ideas: I hear what you just said. You\u2019re paying attention, and they matter. And giving the green light signals trust, which empowers others. 4. It creates an environment where it\u2019s safe to try, fail, learn, and innovate. When you freely say yes, you create a risk-tolerant environment. You encourage innovation by trying new things and using the successes and failures as learning opportunities. 5. It makes life more fun. Saying yes can bring you new sources of joy and lead you on an incredible adventure. #leadership   #career   #growth \n \n \n \u2026see more", "reactions": 194, "comments": 52, "author": "Amy Blaschka"}, "label": 1}, {"post_a": {"id": "245", "text": "This piece focuses on how to think about the future of education and whether we can even make predictions.

Here\u2019s how to become more selfless with your self-awareness:   Don\u2019t assume that you know how others perceive you. What we think we\u2019re projecting and how others are receiving our energy can be two very different things. To bridge the gap, seek the input of others.   Press the pause button. Our never-ending activity often leaves us feeling stressed, and we can\u2019t help but bring that negativity with us in our interactions with others. But by regularly hitting the proverbial pause button, you\u2019ll allow yourself a few moments to reset.   Be intentional. Before you head into a team huddle, begin a pitch, or meet with a client, make a conscious choice about what energy you want to project and then do that.   Hone your powers of observation. How aware of you of others and your environment? The best way to increase your powers of observation is to pay attention.

Each day in your To-Do list, before you do anything else, take at least one action that has no other purpose than to be kind to another person. 3. Stand out for the positive in a proactive and vocal way. As a business leader, you have an opportunity to use kindness to share your core beliefs and insights through your social media posts, your company's values statement, and in the way in which you tell your own story.

I took the video below while walking through Fort Mason this weekend. Not in Missouri, or Texas, or Georgia. This was in the heart of San Francisco, California. 90+ percent of people there weren't wearing masks. Most were young. Lots wore t-shirts with names of companies most would recognize.  This, in a time when doctors, nurses and frontline workers are literally fighting for their lives so we can live ours. COVID-19 doesn't know or care about you, your social wants and needs, or your political beliefs. Just because you're young and healthy doesn't mean you can't infect someone else - quite the opposite. This asymptomatic pandemic has killed people of all ages, and continues to ravage the world. So stop the posturing and the bravado. Please. Stop being cavalier and careless. We haven't won the fight.

My response was that you cannot map or prepare every step of your career to optimize for aha moments.  Instead, aha moments come, go, and may reemerge just like opportunities. Instead of anticipating for aha moments, keep a curious and open mind on opportunities that come your way. Be surrounded by peers and mentors who can help identify these moments. Aha moments will come in different shapes and sizes, but also at different times. It's so so easy to start comparing ourselves to others then try to expedite our own timeline. While some competition is healthy and we should always act with a sense of urgency, never feel that need to fit and adhere yourselves to someone else's timeline.

If you draw a hard line that is a big gap from the investor's assessment of the valuation, most often they will disengage. Also, negotiating down significantly hurts your credibility.   3. Pitch: CEOs should own & lead the conversation with the investors. Sometimes, the banker takes over while presenting, hurting the CEO's credibility. Investors like CEOs to have ownership of the numbers that they are committing.   4. Communication: Another mistake is not communicating the business proposition early in the presentation. Pace the presentation for 35 mins & communicate the uniqueness of the product that makes you win the market up front.   5.

The Non-Volatile Memory Express (NVMe) protocol is one of the most powerful new innovations designed to accelerate data processing. IBM Storage has been rapidly moving forward with implementing NVMe-based solutions across its entire storage portfolio. The  IBM  FlashSystem family of data systems has already incorporated NVMe capabilities into its High-End Enterprise and Midrange Enterprise FlashSystem.

Rather than risk rejection for being different, it\u2019s safer to blend in. But in a professional sense, that can be a big mistake.

Smart TVs and internet-connected DVD players were not widespread. Enter gaming consoles. Why? Because the goal was to get Netflix on as many internet-connected devices as quickly as possible. And game consoles already had installed user bases in the tens of millions and their consoles were all connected to the internet. So Netflix partnered with  Microsoft  XBOX,  Sony  PS3, and, believe it or not,  Nintendo  Wii. This was a mock-up of the sticker used on XBOX360 LIVE Gold physical packaging from 2008.

The tireless 80-year-old has poured everything she has, including her pension, into providing much-needed health care to a population with one of the highest maternal and infant mortality rates in the world -- a situation that's been exasperated by Somalia's long civil war, which led to the death or departure of nearly all of the country's health care workers.

But empathy is about putting yourself in someone else\u2019s shoes and seeing things from their perspective.   How can YOU be more a more empathetic leader?   First, shift your mindset to put people first. See them as human beings rather than a means to the end of a transaction or task.   Next, ask thoughtful and probing questions that draw out implications and feelings.   Finally, use your awareness to give others your full attention and truly listen to what matters most to them.   When you do these things, you\u2019ll better understand your customers, colleagues, and partners, and then be able to use those insights in ways to better serve and communicate with them.

Though it might sound counterintuitive, sometimes, the best way to move forward is to go backward; here\u2019s how:   First, take time to reflect Before the coronavirus crisis, you likely felt over-programmed and overworked with no time to think. Now is the perfect time to harness the power of the pause and take a break. To maximize this period, slow down and carve out time in your calendar for quiet reflection.    Next, refocus your efforts After you\u2019ve reflected, record, and review your thoughts to see if any common themes emerge. Now\u2019s the time to refocus your efforts on looking for new opportunities that align your skillset or offering with current demand.    Finally, re-engage by taking action Once you\u2019ve had time to reflect and refocus your efforts, create and execute a plan. Taking action is the antidote to fear, doubt, and anxiety\u2014and stagnation. In these trying times, re-engaging by taking action helps move you closer to your goals, which spurs you on; action begets more action.    #career   #progress   #coronavirus \n \n \n \u2026see more", "reactions": 179, "comments": 71, "author": "Amy Blaschka"}, "label": 1}, {"post_a": {"id": "7114", "text": "Here in the link to Fed Chair Powell's opening remarks at the PIIE event: https://lnkd.in/e5456T5 Looking through them now. #economy   #markets   #centralbanks   Federal Reserve Board   #fed   #federalreserve \n \n \n \u2026see more", "reactions": 65, "comments": 5, "author": "Mohamed El-Erian"}, "post_b": {"id": "340", "text": "So, I am worried about children and their difficulty with school closures and social distancing.

I've thought a lot about influence the past few years. I gave a talk on it a few weeks ago. The reason why my legs were shaking and the reason why that hug met so much is this:  I can go back and pinpoint the moment where Gary impacted my life. I was in the weight room, in college, and my triple jump coach told me to check out a guy named \"GaryVee.\" And from there I went down the rabbit hole of entrepreneurship and content. Failed with two companies but found a lot of success with the third. Gary is impacting others & creating those data points at scale for other people.

Of course, running a company the size of Tesla is plenty challenging. But Musk is also CEO of space exploration company SpaceX, which has a stated mission of taking humans to Mars and \"other destinations in the solar system.\" And that's not all. Musk has also founded or currently plays major roles in a number of other companies. So, how does Musk do it? How does he manage his time, so he can keep his finger on the pulse of so many things? Musk revealed a very simple yet effective productivity hack in an interview some years ago: He splits his time so that he can basically focus on one company at a time. Of course, few of us are trying to run multiple companies as Musk is, nor do we have access to a private jet. But I've found great value in separating different aspects of my work by days of the week.  The key is not to try to do as much as Musk does in a week.

First - the average age of people who asked for our advice: 26-33. I can explain it mostly by experience, 26-33 usually are employees at the beginning of their careers, and companies prefer to keep the seniors because they're more expensive to hire and of course, more valuable. Second, 1 out of 5 people is a software developer! Well, I was amazed by this one. I would think that SW people who are in high demand would be the last to get fired. I can explain it with 2 ideas - first, most of them are juniors /from small startups that had to close, second, AdviceMe's branding was especially oriented for tech people. Another interesting piece of data- 80% of the people who asked for our advice had at least an undergrad degree. The higher education was the fewer people there were. I guess companies won't let go so fast of people with high education. Also, 90% of people with 3rd degree had a managerial experience which is not a surprise.

Studies show that young people who have high creative potential have increased self awareness and as a result, often struggle in the area of personal identity development.

Our organization is designed to provide the tools and access necessary to help youth of all backgrounds and socioeconomic status discover, develop, and deliver their creative gifts in a safe space.

It was easier for me to write because I didn\u2019t have so many demands on my time. But the more popular the book became, the more distracted I got, flitting from one thing to the next, always checking my device.   When I sat down to write or work on other projects, I would check emails or the news, just to distract myself. Because at the time, I didn\u2019t have the right techniques in place.   Learning how to manage my time and attention, turned into a project that eventually became my second book: Indistractable!   I didn't write the book because I had superhuman self-control. I wrote it because I didn't.   And one of the important things I realized was that learning to control my attention didn't just help me finish my work on time. It helped me in my relationships with my wife and daughter. It helped me align my schedule with my values.

Brands matter.  We live in a world of options and commoditization. Whether you\u2019re an individual or a corporation, your brand is what distinguishes you from all other lookalike options, and defines your place in the world.  2. A brand is a promise.  Branding goes deeper than colors, font, logos, or a headshot. It\u2019s a promise you make to the world; this is the kind of experience you will have with me.  Live up to that promise, consistently. 3. Perception is reality.  Marketing, at its core, is about changing perception. Building a personal brand is about being thoughtful about the perception the world has about you.  Use it to get you where you want to go, not to satisfy your ego. Clarify your end-game. 4. Ask for three words. If you\u2019re stuck defining yourself in a pithy way (it\u2019s not easy) ask friends and colleagues to describe you in three words.  Look for patterns.  5. Be yourself. Don\u2019t try to be the person you think you should be. Have confidence in what you bring to the table. Your best brand strengths come from what differentiates you.

The first step in making a  #choice  is the  #awareness  that you have one. At this stage, it\u2019s not about editing yourself on what\u2019s possible; it\u2019s about being mindful that change starts with you and your attitude. (Note: choosing not to make a change is also a choice; if you\u2019re not changing it, you\u2019re choosing it.) 2. Attention with Intention Once you\u2019ve realized that change is an internal job, consider those things within your control and how they impact\u2014for better or worse\u2014what you want. Bring your  #attention  to your  #intention , and ask yourself what\u2019s the one thing you can do right now to bring you closer to your  #goals . This need not be a grandiose, sweeping gesture; the biggest change starts with a small step in a new direction. 3. Action This last step may seem obvious, but far too often, we fail to act even when we know that making a change is in our best interest. Nothing changes if nothing changes.

And I had her in my head and I would play around with being her in my bedroom and with certain people, but the gift of age is that you actually get to have the boldness and the courage to be that woman, to be that person and I\u2019m experiencing it now and some of the things I\u2019ve discovered in knowing myself is that I actually like myself,\u201d she said.

And I knew this former little girl who used to sit on the levee wall looking out over the Ohio River in Cairo, Illinois and dream about amazing adventures and making a difference in the world really is the woman she always dreamed she could be.

Maybe a few people are missing the point and maybe missing an opportunity. For example the last door to escape the building is not likely to be Fire Door because it doesn't form part of a compartment. Does that mean the Inspector would leave if out of their scope? If a door is on an escape route but isn't necessarily a FD30 or FD60 should it still be inspected against BSEN179 and/or BSEN1125? yes it should. so maybe there are a number of doors in a building that aren't necessarily Fire doors but do form part of an escape route and are integral to life safety, yet the discussions seem to be about just the Fire doors.

The Cookery in Shirlington (Arlington) VA is having an event June 1 starting at noon in their remarkable cooking/food store for International Children's Day. And, they will be making a donation to Save the Children. I will be doing a book reading and signing at this event -- with two of my newest children's books. There will be food, fun and activities. One of the goals is to enable children to appreciate the fun that can come from engaged reading and the books are meant to achieve that.  Also, given the starvation and deaths of children across the globe, it is worth pausing and reflecting on what we can do to improve the lives of the next generation -- near and far. There is homelessness and food scarcity in many areas -- hidden and not so hidden poverty and a deep inequality for children in education too. That gets me to my next point: I will be at Molly Stark School in VT (which is I believe close to 100% free and reduced lunch) on June 3 to read and work with children.  I will be sharing one of the new books and helping kids appreciate the value of words and reading.

Commercially produced distractions, like television or social media, use slot machine-like variable rewards to keep us engaged with a constant stream of newness.  But we can use the same techniques to make any task more pleasurable and compelling. We can use the same neural hardwiring that keeps us hooked to media to keep us engaged in an otherwise unpleasant task. Given what we know about our propensity for distraction when we\u2019re uncomfortable, reimagining difficult work as fun could prove incredibly empowering. Imagine how powerful you\u2019d feel if you were able to transform the hard, focused work you have to do into something that felt like play. Fun and play don\u2019t have to make us feel good per se; rather they can be used as tools to keep us focused. Instead of running away from our pain or using rewards like prizes and treats to help motivate us, the idea is to pay such close attention that you find new challenges you didn\u2019t see before. Those new challenges provide the novelty to engage our attention and maintain focus when tempted by distraction. #Indistractable   #Productivity   #Empowerment   #Engagement   #Traction \n \n \n \u2026see more", "reactions": 82, "comments": 15, "author": "Nir Eyal"}, "label": 0}, {"post_a": {"id": "30172", "text": "#namaste  goes universal.

The Fund, when matched with State and Territory funding, will support up to 300,000 apprentices, trainees, pre-apprentices and higher level skilled Australians.

There are no rules for this stuff. I finished TEDx two months ago and it was 7 months of prep. I just did Disrupt Madison and I prepped for maybe a total of 5 hours over time. And I knew what I wanted to say... and then for the first time I walked on stage and everything went blank. I forgot everything that I wanted to say. So I winged it. And it went fine. But I hate not being THE BEST. And I\u2019m really working to find my balance. On camera I don\u2019t really prep. On the stage (personally) I\u2019m learning that the more prep the better. Preparation is the best weapon. Kind of like when I was a musician. You play a song so much that it\u2019s burned into your memory. You can go off script and still come back to the song because it\u2019s become muscle memory. People have taken flights/driven from other cities/countries to come see me speak.

You have top of the funnel, middle, bottom. Awareness all the way down to the conversion (or sale).    Everything that is going on right now is top of the funnel.

Here are three ways you might not have as much EQ as you think (and what to do instead):   1. You pride yourself on speaking your mind. While candor in the workplace can be valuable, not every thought should be voiced immediately (or maybe, ever), especially in an emotionally-charged situation.   Instead: Press the pause button. Emotionally intelligent people understand the power of taking a beat to digest and consider information before responding to it.    2. You treat every employee you manage the same. You're trying to be fair, so you employ the same management methods with every member of your team, regardless of their needs, and expect them to conform.   Instead: Move away from a one-size-fits-all mentality. People are individuals, with unique needs. Take the time to learn about what your direct reports need, and then adapt your style to serve them.   3. You're \"coin-operated.\" Being \"coin-operated\" means you're motivated by money\u2014and little else.   Instead: Find motivation in the challenge.

The onus is on a company to make its promotions\u2019 process well-defined and transparent. When employees are clear about how decisions are made on promotions, they know what is expected of them, and where their company is headed. Otherwise, employees are demoralised, and engage in unproductive guesswork, which helps nobody.

Also, criteria for promotions in one company may not work for another. It\u2019s the guiding philosophy of the leadership team which determines the \u2018culture\u2019 of a company.  Michael C.

It is interesting to see how everyone now just accepts that the 'queue' means adding media to a list because that wasn't always the case. Back in the early days at  Netflix , no one was using it that way. And while it didn't really line up with the definition or common usage of the word in English, it was unique and considered to be an \"ownable\" brand asset here in the United States. Again, \"ownable\" meaning no one here was using it in that way. Because no one was using it that way we had to constantly educate prospective members as to what the Queue was. And there were always discussions about changing it. But any company could have a \"movie list\" so it remained in use.  As the company grew over the years, so too did the adoption of that use of the word. Competitors and even non-movie related companies used it to mean the same thing.  Which is how we arrived at having that be the default for \"add media to a list.\" Of course, since Netflix has become a global streaming service, they've moved to \"My List\" but the effects of using Queue as a brand asset appear to be rather long-lasting. #apple   #netflix   #queue   #brandassets   #brand \n \n \n \u2026see more", "reactions": 9, "comments": 8, "author": "Barry W.

Not all of these reasons but maybe some of them. \u279e Being bossed around by people we don't respect. \u279e Being forced to be friends just because they share our cubicle walls \u279e Meetings \u279e Seeing the 80/20 rule in action where 20% of the employees create 80% of the value and the other 80% just barely survive. \u279e Being mandated by an 800 page guidebook how you can talk to people of the opposite sex or of different skin colors. \u279e Seeing corporate political agendas rule over financial realities and not being able to say anything about it for fear of being fired. \u279e Spending 6am to 7pm getting ready for work, commuting to work, working, commuting back, too tired to move when you return home. #Jobs are not so great. And they cause a lot of suffering. And you don't really need them.

It's easy to cast blame on others who held power in the past. But anyone holding a leadership position for more than a year or two has to take responsibility for current messes/mistakes. And, new leaders, this is hard and I know from experience and my own errors: you can only blame your predecessor and institutional bad acts for so long.  Once one gets the lay of the land, a leader owns the institution's past. Ownership is key to trustworthiness, the ability to live with oneself and to take real action.  Blame gets you nowhere. Why do I raise this now? With all the institutions struggling with one crisis or another, particularly in education, we can see the value of being forthright.  Stand up and own what went/is wrong. And, then take the steps needed to remedy the situation. Think Georgetown owning its slave past. Remarkable. Think Penn State not owning its silence. Troubling.  And, by the by, PR folks would agree: It's best for institutions moving forward if their leaders step forward.

And then it's back to business as usual...you don't see those women again until the next year. It's same with corporate boards.

Starting a company is like jumping off a cliff and assembling a plane on the way down, according to Reid Hoffman. I agree with his analogy. Starting up is hard and too many wrong moves in a row can lead to a crash landing. But many well-executed moves and your startup can soar and succeed. Some people are ok with ambiguity and can thrive in these high risk, high reward environments. 2. Getting an MBA can be compared to spending time sharpening an axe before going to cut a tree.

Watch for non-verbal cues Customers with crossed arms as you\u2019re pitching a new concept to them probably aren\u2019t open to it.

Notice conflicting cues. 3. Read between the lines If you and your client have relaxed, conversational email exchanges that suddenly become more formal, it could be a signal that your project has gone off the rails.

They didn't sell or hype about the flavour. They sold the story of perception. It's cool to drink an icy cola drink. I'm a baby chick compared to them. My journey started 10 years ago!

When we focus on the negative what-ifs\u2014\u201cWhat if I fail?\u201d and \u201cWhat if I embarrass myself?\u201d\u2014we remain in a vicious cycle of inertia and perceived inadequacy.

To grow, you need courage; courage requires taking action.  Sad but true: There is no growth in the status quo.

Challenging yourself to leave your cocoon helps you stretch your wings and gain new skills, experience, and confidence. Action begets more action\u2014and success. When you use awareness to make action an intentional habit, you train yourself to continue to take action. Over time, those small changes in behavior creatively shake things up and breathe new life into old methods and routines.

Maybe it\u2019s spending more time in prayer or meditation. Whatever it may be, we can all emerge out of this with a renewed understanding of our values.  #Indistractable   #Scheduling   #Values   #COVID19 \n \n \n \u2026see more", "reactions": 104, "comments": 19, "author": "Nir Eyal"}, "post_b": {"id": "33496", "text": "In my latest  Forbes  article, I share how a foursome from Australia is harnessing the power of social media for social good, raising awareness and funds to fight the fires raging in their homeland.

Even if the attendees met again, the dynamics would shift, and thus, the experience would never be the same. In this way, each meeting is unique and to be treasured. It\u2019s important to note that a tea ceremony was designed to make this concept possible by asking its participants\u2014samurai and wealthy noblemen, as well as farmers and everyday people\u2014to come together as equals.  In the tea house, no one outranks another, and everyone has something to contribute. To enter the tea house, one must leave one\u2019s non-essentials (the samurai\u2019s sword and helmet, for example) outside and then pass through an intentionally low opening, bowing as one does so.
